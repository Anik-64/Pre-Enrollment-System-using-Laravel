## About

This project is designed for a university pre-enrollment system, featuring two roles: admin and student where

- Students can:
  - Create their portfolios
  - View all available courses and their credit hours
  - Create enrollment

- Admins can:
  - Modify courses and credit hours
  - Modify departments
  - Can control the enrollment using active or inactive the sessions ( like as spring, fall )
  - View system login information
  - Take actions based on overlapping student enrollments
  - Print overlapping student details

The primary objective of the project is to identify and compile a list of students, by subject, who are retaking or repeating courses from previous semesters and wish to enroll in them again. This situation can lead to scheduling conflicts due to overlapping class or exam times. The project assists advisors in determining whether to approve these students for enrollment.
